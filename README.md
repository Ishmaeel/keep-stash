# KeepStash v1.0
"Permanent" player stash addon for [S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly v1.5.1](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly)

# Installation
* Extract the gamedata wherever it will give you the greatest joy, dear Bates, I would want you to extract it nowhere less. 
* Requires [Anomaly Mod Configuration Menu (MCM)](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/anomaly-mod-configuration-menu).

# And Then?
You will see a **Protect Player Stashes** checkbox under MCM options. While checked, any stashes you have in the world by using backpacks will be *permanent*.

Taking all items from a personal stash will no longer remove the backpack from the ground, enabling you to set up base camps with reusable stashes.

When you really want to destroy a stash and retrieve the backpack, you can hold down <kbd>Control</kbd> key while emptying a stash. (Or disable this under MCM, that'll work too.)

*Note:* All stashes in Anomaly are already safe. This addon is not needed to protect the *contents*. 
This is only for keeping *empty* personal stashes on the ground so you will not have to put them down again after you take all items accidentally or intentionally.
